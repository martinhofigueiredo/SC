AT THIS point they came in sight of thirty forty windmills that there are on plain, and as soon as Don Quixote saw
them he said to his squire,

"Fortune is arranging matters for us better than we could have shaped our desires ourselves,
for look there, friend Sancho Panza, where thirty or more monstrous giants present themselves,
all of whom I mean to engage in battle and slay, and with whose spoils we shall begin to make
our fortunes; for this is righteous warfare, and it is God's good service to sweep so evil a
breed from off the face of the earth."

"What giants?" said Sancho Panza.

"Those thou seest there," answered his master, "with the long arms, and some have them nearly two leagues long."

"Look, your worship," said Sancho; "what we see there are not giants but windmills, and what seem to be their arms
are the sails that turned by the wind make the millstone go."

"It is easy to see," replied Don Quixote, "that thou art not used to this business of adventures; those are giants;
and if thou art afraid, away with thee out of this and betake thyself to prayer while I engage them in fierce and
unequal combat."

So saying, he gave the spur to his steed Rocinante, heedless of the cries his squire Sancho sent after him, warning
him that most certainly they were windmills and not giants he was going to attack. He, however, was so positive they
were giants that he neither heard the cries of Sancho, nor perceived, near as he was, what they were, but made at
them shouting,

"Fly not, cowards and vile beings, for a single knight attacks you."
